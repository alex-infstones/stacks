Welcome to fdisk (util-linux 2.34).
Changes will remain in memory only, until you decide to write them.
Be careful before using the write command.

Device does not contain a recognized partition table.
Created a new DOS disklabel with disk identifier 0x2ea4ad78.

Command (m for help): Partition type
   p   primary (0 primary, 0 extended, 4 free)
   e   extended (container for logical partitions)
Select (default p): Partition number (1-4, default 1): First sector (2048-648019967, default 2048): Last sector, +/-sectors or +/-size{K,M,G,T,P} (2048-648019967, default 648019967): 
Created a new partition 1 of type 'Linux' and of size 309 GiB.

Command (m for help): The partition table has been altered.
